# LogoShield
"My project is called LogoShield, and it is a counterfeit logo detection system.
We use ensemble-based deep learning with three pre-trained models: VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2.
We combine the results using a soft voting method, which improves accuracy by considering predictions from all three models.
To make it user-friendly, we built an interface using Streamlit where users can upload an image and instantly see whether the logo is genuine or fake.
The main goal is to help companies protect their brand identity by detecting counterfeit logos in real time."
