# LogoShield
Logo detection system We use ensemble-based deep learning with three pre-trained models: VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2. We combine the results using a soft voting method. To make it user-friendly, we built an interface using Streamlit where users can upload an image and instantly see whether the logo is genuine or fake.
